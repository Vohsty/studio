      <p>Self-love is not selfish; you can not truly love another
      person untill you know how to love yourself. Owning our
      story and loving ourselves though that process is the bravest
       thing that we'll ever do and capturing that moment frame by
      frame is our gratest responsibility. We are always with you as
       you andertake this journey</p>

      <p>If the sight of the blue skies fills you with joy, if a blade
         of grass springing up in the fields has power to move you, if
        the simple things of nature have a message that you understand,
         rejoice, for your soul is alive. Eleonora Duse</p>
